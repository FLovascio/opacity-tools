# opacity-tools
The ```opacity-tools``` package aims to provide a portable library for calculating opacities with multilanguage support.
Target applications are on-the-fly dust opacities in multi-dust hydrocodes and radiative transfer codes. The library offers support for different grain compositions (currently) using Brugemann effective medium approximation, and arbitrary dust grain size distributions. Both integrated Rosseland & Planck opacities and wavelength dependant opacities (for use with multigroup radiadive transfer codes) can be calculated.
